# FRC Robot Code
This is a collection of all the FRC robot code I have contributed to. Some code was taken from repositories of team GitHub organizations which I am a part of.

Note: Robot code in this repository was written over the course of a short, six week build season. This means that most of the code is generally very messy and may not follow conventional principles and a uniform style guide.
